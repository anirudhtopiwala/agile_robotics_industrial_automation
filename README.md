# General tips 

* Create your own branch and work independently on it.
* Once you think your work is done, inform the team. 
* **Don't merge or commit to the master branch!**
* Please follow Google CPP guidelines while writing the code. 
* Try incorporating OOP concepts in the code right from the start because we will be building next projects on the top of this project. 
* This is not trivial so please start working on it as soon as possible.
